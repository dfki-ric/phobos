# Git LFS for mesh repositories

This repo uses git-lfs for the mesh repositories to save you some disk space and download time.

If you check out this repo via autoproj and you have included this model-group's package_set, autoproj will take care of it.

If you are checking out this repo via git you probably have to install git-lfs first:

- If you haven't used git-lfs before you probably have to do:
```
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```

- If you once have added git-lfs to your repos simply do:
```
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

Afterwards git-lfs will take care of checking out the lfs files for you when you use `git`.

## Troubleshooting

Normally, Autoproj supports git-lfs (see [here](https://www.rock-robotics.org/rock-and-syskit/workspace/add_packages.html#git-lfs)).
However, sometimes it seems to have trouble using git-lfs especially, if you haven't got a fresh bootstrap.


**How to check if something went wrong**

Have a look into one of your mesh files. If everything is alright, it should be a binary or at least a very large file - depending on the type.
If something went wrong there'll be just three lines which refer to git-lfs with a hash of the respective file.


**Here is how you can fix your issue:**

1. Do the steps above to install git-lfs manually on you system.

2. Go into the repo you are having trouble with.
    ```
    cd $FAULTY_MODEL_REPO
    ```

3. Get the remote url and copy it.
    ```
    git remote -v
    ```
4. Remove the faulty model repo:
    ```
    cd ..
    rm -rf $FAULTY_MODEL_REPO
    ```
5. Make sure git lfs is initialized and check out the repo manually:
    ```
    git lfs install
    git clone $THE_REPO_REMOTE_URL $FAULTY_MODEL_REPO
    ```
6. If you are using a special branch (e.g. develop) check it out:
    ```
    git checkout develop
    ```
7. Get the submodules:
    ```
    git submodule update --init
    ```
8. Everything should be fine now. But maybe you might want to rename your remote:
    ```
    git remote rename origin autobuild
    ```
